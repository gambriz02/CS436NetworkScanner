# Send network probe packets

    # use nmap to discover hosts on network
        #parse nmap for a list of devices on network
    # use scapy to send packets to hosts and record returned results

# analyze returned results (probably using scapy)

    # Parser for responses
    # build out a table:
    # | hostname | IP | MAC | open ports | services |
